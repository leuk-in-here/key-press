Hello there!

This is a simple script to read and trigger keystrokes.

It uses Python and is based off Pynput.

For more details regarding Pynput, check this website out - > https://pynput.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html

Pynput basically gives access to Python to use keypresses.

  Well, what is this really useful for?

This is useful in the setting where by you are unable to copy and paste information that you might need to.

An example is a website that prevents pasting in text boxes -> this technically can bypass that by instead typing into the input.txt
The script then converts the input.txt into character presses.
I've not tested the limits of languages outside of English so use at your own risk

Downsides
- This program once initiated will basically lock you out of being able to use keyboard or mouse properly.
- The script uses your cursor and active window as a starting point.
- The only way to terminate it within the active window is to create a failsafe to disable the code through alternative means
- I have not coded the failsafe.

USE AT YOUR OWN RISK.

Basically TEST THE CODE IN A NOTEPAD.
